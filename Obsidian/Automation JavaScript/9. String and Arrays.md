### STRINGS
- It is a special object that is used to store and manipulate sequence of character.
```JS
const simpleString = 'I am string';
const simpleString2 = "I am string too";
const templateString = `I am template string ${simpleString}`;
```
- #### [Length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length) property
	- The length data property of a String value contains the length of the string in UTF-16 code units.
```JS
const simpleString = 'I am string';
console.log(simpleString.length); // 11
```
- #### [charAt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/charAt)  
	- The String object's charAt() method returns a new string consisting of the single UTF-16 code unit located at the specified offset into the string.
```JS
const sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.';
const index = 4;
console.log(`The character at index ${index} is ${sentence.charAt(index)}`); //Output: "The character at index 4 is q"
```

- #### Popular methods
	- slice()
		- Extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string, without modifying the original string.
		- Parameters:
			1. indexStart (String) - The index of the first character to include in the returned substring.
			2. indexEnd (String) - The index of the first character to exclude from the returned substring.
	- trim()
		- Removes whitespace from both ends of a string and returns a new string, without modifying the original string. Whitespace in this context is all the whitespace characters (space, tab, no-break space, etc.) and all the line terminator characters (LF, CR, etc.).
	- toUperCase()
		- Returns the calling string value converted to uppercase (the value will be converted to a string if it isn't one).
	- toLowerCase()
		- Returns the calling string value returns the calling string value converted to lower case.
	- split()
		- Takes a pattern and divides a String into an ordered list of substrings by searching for the pattern, puts these substrings into an array, and returns the array.
	- match()
		- Retrieves the result of matching a string against a [regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions).
		- Parameters:
			- regexp (String) - A regular expression object, or any object that has a Symbol.match method.
	- replace()
		- Returns a new string with one, some, or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. The pattern can be a string or a RegExp, and the replacement can be a string or a function called for each match. If pattern is a string, only the first occurrence will be replaced. The original string is left unchanged.
		- Parameters:
			- pattern Can be a string or an object with a Symbol.replace method — the typical example being a regular expression. Any value that doesn't have the Symbol.replace method will be coerced to a string.
			- replacement Can be a string or a function.
