Sequence of  instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit.

- **Decomposing** a complex programming task into simpler steps: this is one of the two main tools of structured programming, along with data structures
- **Reducing duplicate code** within a program
- Enabling **reuse** of code across multiple programs
- **Dividing** a large programming task among various programmers or various stages of a project
- **Hiding implementation** details from users of the subroutine
- **Improving readability** of code by replacing a block of code with a function call where a descriptive function name serves to describe the block of code. This makes the calling code concise and readable even if the function is not meant to be reused.
- **Improving traceability** by not decomposing the code into subroutines, debugging would be severely impaired

#### Properties
- Function is an object
- Function is first-class citizen

#### Function declaration
Defines a function with the specified parameters.

## Function expression
Can be used to define a function inside an [expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function).
```JS
const sum = function(a, b){
	return a + b;
}

const pow = function power(base, exp){
	if (exp === 0) return 1;
	else return power(base, exp - 1) * base;
} //Not hoisted
```

>The function expression cannot be invoked before declaration.

## IIFE  [(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE)

Is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.
```JS
// Example of IIFE
(function (){
  console.log('Hello World!')
})()
// Output: Hello World!

// Example of IIFE with parameters
const myFunc = (function (name){
  return 'Hello ' + name
})('World!')
console.log(myFunc);
// Output: Hello World!
```
