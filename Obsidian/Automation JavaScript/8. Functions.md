Sequence of  instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit.
- **Decomposing** a complex programming task into simpler steps: this is one of the two main tools of structured programming, along with data structures
- **Reducing duplicate code** within a program
- Enabling **reuse** of code across multiple programs
- **Dividing** a large programming task among various programmers or various stages of a project
- **Hiding implementation** details from users of the subroutine
- **Improving readability** of code by replacing a block of code with a function call where a descriptive function name serves to describe the block of code. This makes the calling code concise and readable even if the function is not meant to be reused.
- **Improving traceability** by not decomposing the code into subroutines, debugging would be severely impaired

#### Properties
- Function is an object
- Function is first-class citizen

#### Declaration
- Defines a function with the specified parameters.

## [Function expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function)
- Can be used to define a function inside an expression.
```JS
const sum = function(a, b){
	return a + b;
}

const pow = function power(base, exp){
	if (exp === 0) return 1;
	else return power(base, exp - 1) * base;
} //Not hoisted
```

>[!Important]
>The function expression cannot be invoked before declaration.

## [IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE)
- Is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.
```JS
// Example of IIFE
(function (){
  console.log('Hello World!')
})()
// Output: Hello World!

// Example of IIFE with parameters
const myFunc = (function (name){
  return 'Hello ' + name
})('World!')
console.log(myFunc);
// Output: Hello World!
```

## [Default parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters)
* Allow named parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or "undefined" is passed.

## [Arrow function expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
- Is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, but is limited and can't be used in all situations.
- There are differences between arrow functions and traditional functions, as well as some limitations:
	- **Don't have their own bindings to this**, arguments or super, and **should not be used as methods**.
	- **Don't have access to the new.target keyword**.
	- **Aren't suitable for call, apply and bind** methods, which generally rely on establishing a scope.
	- **Cannot be used as constructors**.
	- **Cannot use yield**, within its body.

>[!Important]
>No keyword 'function'
NOT hoisted
Has no 'this'


## [Closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) 
- Is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

## [Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions)
- Starting with ECMAScript 2015, a shorter syntax for method definitions on objects initializers is introduced. It is a shorthand for a function assigned to the method's name.
